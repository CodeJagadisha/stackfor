ROBIN LINUX 

These are the instructions to create Robin Linux from scratch, using the directions
at Linux From Scratch (http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/)

XX. Create a basic Debian install

XX. Run "robin-lfs-01.sh". This will install a few extra things.

XX. Run "robin-lfs-02.sh". This will check to makd sure that host requirements are met (see http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/lfs/view/stable/chapter02/hostreqs.html)

    To see whether your host system has all the appropriate versions, and the ability to compile programs, run the following:




    Also check for some library consistency: 

        cat > library-check.sh << "EOF"
        #!/bin/bash
        for lib in lib{gmp,mpfr,mpc}.la; do
        echo $lib: $(if find /usr/lib* -name $lib|
                    grep -q $lib;then :;else echo not;fi) found
        done
        unset lib
        EOF

        bash library-check.sh
