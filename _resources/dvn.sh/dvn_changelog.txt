[NEW] Added the "--no-prereqs" flag. This can be used to supress the installtion of prerequisite packages, which
      can be helpful if you have run "dvn.sh --standard", and now want to run "dvn.sh --no-prereqs --kitchensink.
      Keep in mind that now "dvn.sh" (without arguments) will always attempt to install prerequisite packages.
