CREATING A BASE IMAGE
=====================

- Base memory: 3072MB (recommended), or a value that best suits your needs/host
- Processors: 1 (recommended), or a value that best suits your needs/host
- Video Memory: 128MB, or a value that best suits your needs/host
- Acceleration: 3D (recommended), or none if you are not planning on using a GUI
- HDD: 64GB Dynamic .vdi, or a value that best suits your needs/host

* Hostname:     You can enter whatever you would like your hostname to be. By default, the crispy hostname is
                "robin", but this is really personal preference. 
* Root user:    Allow a root user. By default the password should be "crispy", but that's up to you. It is
                important to have a root user, though, so definately create one.
* Normal user:  Create a normal user with the username, fullname, and password of "crispy. This is required.
* Partitioning: You can just let the installer make the partitioning choices for you. By default, crispy is pretty
                aggressive with partitioning, and does not include a swap partition. Also, and this is important,
                the type of partition table should be "msdos", otherwise you won't be able to compress the .vdi
                properly. If you are using a fixed disk, you can choose whichever partition table type you like.
* Drivers:      Choose "targeted" when asked what type of drivers to include in initrd
* Non-free sw:  Choose "yes" when asked if you would like non-free software included
* Services:     Select all services
* Packages:     Unselect all packages
* Bootloader:   When asked which device you would like to user for boot loader installation, choose the harddisk
                (i.e. "/dev/sda (ata-VBOX_HARDDISK_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX).


1. Login as "root".

2. The crispy user must able to install packages and modify the system, so you'll need to install the sudo package:

    $ apt-get install sudo

3. Add to sudoers

    $ visudo

    Add this to the bottom of the file: "crispy ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL"

4. Auto-login

    $ nano /lib/systemd/system/getty@.service

    Change "ExecStart=-/sbin/agetty --noclear %I $TERM" to "ExecStart=-/sbin/agetty --noclear -a crispy %I $TERM"

5. Cleanup 

    $ sudo apt-get autoremove
    $ sudo apt-get autoclean
    $ sudo apt-get clean
    $ history -cw
    $ sudo e4defrag /
    $ cat /dev/zero > zero.file
    $ sync
    $ rm zero.file
    $ sudo shutdown -h now

6. Compress the .vdi:

    C:\Program Files\Oracle\VirtualBox>VBoxManage.exe modifyhd --compact "<LOCATION-OF-CRISPY.VDI"
